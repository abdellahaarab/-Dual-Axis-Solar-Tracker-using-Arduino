# -Dual-Axis-Solar-Tracker-using-Arduino
An open-source Arduino project to build a dual-axis solar tracking system using 4 LDRs and 2 servo motors. The tracker dynamically follows the sun throughout the day by adjusting a solar panel in both horizontal (azimuth) and vertical (elevation) directions, improving solar efficiency up to 40%.
